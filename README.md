# MLS_Position_Predictor_KNN

In this analysis, I import some data from American Soccer Analysis. I use some of the variables and try to predict a player's position using a K Nearest Neighbors machine learning model. I use different values for the parameter K. I track the accuracy for the different values and use the one with highest accuracy as my final model. At the end, I look at the accuracy of the model for each position.

This was a fun little side project that I completed.
